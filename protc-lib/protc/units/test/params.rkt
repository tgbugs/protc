maybe make it a parameterization of some aspect of the ADC or the software? Linking this to how might clarify what we are actually paraming since it has to be something we can take direct action on... a little slider on a computer would definitely count..."

It is really another case of parameterized make....

Hrm, it would seem that there are cases where we need to be able to pass parameters into the output of a *make* call... we currently have #:parameterized-values which could allow us to add a keyword argument to the resulting function produced by the call to *make*...  this still seems like a reasonable way to deal with this"
