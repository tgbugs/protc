;; logically prior in time

;; as a result we do need to make sure that aspects defined by
;; required modules are available to data in this file in the

;; basic model
;; aspect
;; quantity subClassOf aspect
;; quantity hasUnit unit
;; unit subClassOf aspect
;; unit unitizes quantity
;; fundamental subClassOf unit  ; not at all clear we need these defined here
;; derived subClassOf unit  ; not at all clear we need these defined here
;; local-quantity subClassOf quantity  ; note local assuming a co-inertial reference frame in many cases
;; nonlocal-quantity subClassOf quantity  ; has implicit context
;; location, allocation, plane of section, etc. all of reference frames in addition to units
;; allocation reference frames can be quite simple, labeled black box components are sufficient
